# FizzBuzz

This repository has several examples of the fizzbuzz task in different languages. The idea is simple and looks very similar in each language. It counts from 1 to 100 and if the number it's on is divisible by 3, it prints fizz; if the number is divisible by 5, it prints buzz; if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (or 15) it will print fizzbuzz.

My implementations are all very similar. It's typically a for loop that increments an integer, i, and checks to see if the integer is divisible by the above numbers by using the modulus operator. If it is, it will print one of the words to the console. Otherwise, it will just print the integer.

This is a very easy problem. I use this to familiarize myself with a language's syntax more than anything.
